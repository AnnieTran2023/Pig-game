# pig-game
a game for 2 players
The Pig Game is a classic dice game of chance and strategy, where your goal is to be the first player to reach a set number of points. Roll the dice, make decisions, and try to outwit your opponent to claim victory.

# How to Play
Objective: The goal of the game is to reach a certain number of points before your opponent. You can choose the winning score at the beginning of the game.
Taking Turns: The game is played in turns. On your turn, you can roll a six-sided die as many times as you like, accumulating points with each roll. However, if you roll a "1," you lose all the points you've earned during that turn, and it's your opponent's turn.
Hold or Roll: To keep the points you've earned during your turn, you can choose to "Hold," which adds the current turn's points to your total score. Then, it's your opponent's turn.
Winning: The first player to reach the winning score wins the game. If you roll a "1" at any point during your turn, your turn ends, and you lose the points for that turn
